There are two notebooks for MovieLens Collaborative Filtering model training and fine-tuning. Both are the same, but the progress bars were removed from one of them as the metadata from the bars broke the preview on Github:
  1. MovieLens_Collaborative_Filtering_vFinal.ipynb: can be downloaded and/or run in Colab and will have progress bars for training, along with metrics for the test evaluations.
  2. MovieLens_Collaborative_Filtering_vFinal_no_progress_bars.ipynb: has no progress bars or metrics from training and evaluating, but is able to be previewed in Github for quick lookups of code.
