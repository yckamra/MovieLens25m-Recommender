TODO:
1. Create a sparse matrix from our dataset
2. Create a function to calculate cosine similarity between users to find similar users; User-based Collaborative Filtering
3. Create our matrix factorization model
4. Train our model and graph our accuracies and loss
5. Compare our MVP to a Popularity Based Model (just recommends most popular movies) and Item-based Collaborative Filtering (finds similarity in movies vector)
6. (?) Host the current model in the cloud and create API calls

At this point we have an MVP and something that could be submitted

7. Add clustering to tags in order to gain better insights into user preferences; So find movies the user likes and find the similar tags. Then cluster users together based on these tags.
8. Retest our model against our first iteration, Popularity Based Model, and Item-based Collaborative Filtering.
