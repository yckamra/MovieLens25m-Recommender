## MovieLens25m-Recommender
#Overview
This project evaluates several commonly used recommendation system models on the MovieLens 25M dataset using offline evaluation metrics. Offline evaluation lacks real-time user feedback such as click-through rate or retention time. Therefore, this study aims to understand how different models—used in platforms like Netflix and Letterboxd—perform when evaluated purely from existing user-item interactions.

We implement and compare popularity-based, weighted popularity-based, cosine similarity, and matrix factorization (ALS) models.
