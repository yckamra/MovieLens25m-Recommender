TODO:
1. Create a sparse matrix from our dataset
2. Create a function to calculate cosine similarity between users to find similar users
3. Create our matrix factorization model for our MVP
4. Train our model and graph our accuracies and loss
5. Compare this model to another one that exists; this is a baseline
6. (?) Host the current model in the cloud and create API calls

At this point we have an MVP and something that could be submitted

7. Add clustering to tags in order to gain better insights into user preferences
8. Retest our model against another model and our previous model; this compares our new model to a baseline and our improvements on the previous iteration
